# Setup

We have a docker image that gives you the tools that are needed to make changes
to the project and test it. If you use it, you don't have to think about
installing specific versions of libraries needed.

## Build the image

```
./scripts/build_image.sh dev
```

## Run the container

```
./scripts/run.sh dev
```

## Use the container
```
./scripts/enter.sh
```
